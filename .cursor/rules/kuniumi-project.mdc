# Kuniumi Project Instructions

## Project Overview

**Kuniumi** is a Go framework that exposes Go functions as portable web services through multiple interfaces (HTTP, CGI, MCP, Docker containers).

- Language: Go
- Architecture: Modular/Layered

## Directory Structure

- **Specs & Design**: `prompts/phases/` is the source of truth.
  - `000-firstrelease/` — phase name
    - `ideas/` — idea notes and specifications
      - `main/` — branch name (use the current working branch name)
        - `000-xxx.md`, `001-yyy.md` — numbered spec files

## Development Process

**Spec-first**: Before implementing, create/update a specification under `prompts/phases/.../ideas/[branch-name]/`. Spec file names use a 3-digit sequential prefix starting from `000-`.

### Workflow Order

The development workflow uses skills defined in `.cursor/skills/`:

```
[Human: Idea]
       ↓
[AI: create-specification] → Generate spec
       ↓
[Human: Review / Revise / Approve]
       ↓
[AI: create-implementation-plan] → Generate plan
       ↓
[Human: Review / Revise / Approve]
       ↓
[AI: execute-implementation-plan]
       ├→ Coding
       ├→ Testing
       └→ [AI: build-pipeline]
              ├→ scripts/process/build.sh
              └→ scripts/process/integration_test.sh
```

**Key rules**:
- Human review points: after specification and after implementation plan.
- NEVER auto-advance to the next phase without explicit user instruction.
- Progress tracking: use checkboxes in implementation plans (`[ ]` → `[/]` → `[x]`).

## Shell Environment

Always use **bash** for script execution.

- **Windows**: Use Git Bash (not PowerShell). Project scripts under `scripts/` are bash scripts.
- **Mac/Linux**: Use the standard bash shell.

## File Management

- **Intermediate files** (build error logs, debug output, temp docs, PID files) must be placed under `tmp/`.
  - Example: `tmp/build_error.txt`, `tmp/doc_delta.txt`, `tmp/vscode_launch.log`
  - `tmp/` is in `.gitignore` and will not be committed.
